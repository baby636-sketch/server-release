# Contributing 
I'm a little new to properly managing contributions, and using more advanced features of Github, but I'll try to add my observations here about to make a useful contribution that is likely to be accepted.

1. Keep up to date with and make pull requests to the development branch.
https://github.com/FreeTrade/memberdev
The development branch can be previewed at 
https://freetrade.github.io/memberdev/

2. Have a preview URL and include it in your pull request so that your changes can be evaluated easily
It's pretty easy to do with Github Pages
On Github -> Settings->Options->Github Pages

3. Ask for comments on structure or architecture if you're planning to embark on a big feature or change. It might conflict with 
work that's planned or ongoing and may not be accepted if it can't be integrated.

4. One bug fix/new feature per pull request.

5. Don't make big changes to formatting or change unrelated lines of code.

6. Changes to the Member Client only here - changes to the server code on the server repo.

7. Thank you for helping out!
